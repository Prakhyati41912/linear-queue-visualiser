 1. Stack Implemented Using Two Queues
Uses two custom Queue classes to simulate a stack.
Maintains LIFO order using enqueue-dequeue rearrangements.

2. Real-Time Visualization
As you push/pop, the stack is visually updated immediately.
Items are added at the bottom of the HTML stack container and appear stacked.

3. User Interaction
Prompts (alert() and prompt()) guide the user through operations.
Keeps it simple and intuitive for beginners.

4. Stylish Design
Use of flexbox, colored buttons, and hover effects enhance UX.
Background image and styled stack items give a polished look.

5. Logic Separation
Stack logic is neatly implemented using classes (Stack, Queue).
Presentation is separated from logic, following clean code principles.

Example Scenario
If you do the following:
Click Push → Enter 10
Click Push → Enter 20
Click Peek → Alerts 20
Click Pop → Alerts 20
Click Reset → Stack is cleared

You’ll visually see:

Stack showing blocks with values.
Real-time changes based on stack operations.
Alerts showing operation results.
